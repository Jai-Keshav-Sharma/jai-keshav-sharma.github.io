        <h2>Welcome to "This Wasn't in the PPT"</h2>
        
        <p>
            This blog is dedicated to exploring the fascinating worlds of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 
            The name comes from those moments when you realize the real insights weren't in the presentation slides — 
            they're in the deeper understanding, the edge cases, and the practical implementations.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Here, I share my learnings, experiments, and thoughts on various ML/AI topics. Whether you're a beginner 
            trying to understand the basics or an experienced practitioner looking for new perspectives, I hope you'll 
            find something valuable.
        </p>
