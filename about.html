        <h2>Welcome to "This Wasn't in the PPT"</h2>
        
        <p>
            You know that moment in class when the professor glosses over something "trivial" and says 
            "this won't be on the exam" — but then you realize it's actually the key to understanding 
            everything? That's what this blog is about.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <strong>"This Wasn't in the PPT"</strong> is a sarcastic nod to all the crucial concepts, 
            intuitions, and practical insights that somehow never make it into those 200-slide lecture decks. 
            The stuff professors skip. The details buried in footnotes. The "obvious" things that take 
            weeks to truly understand.

            Here, I document my journey through Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence — the real 
            learning that happens outside the classroom, beyond the slides, and often at 2 AM when nothing 
            makes sense until suddenly it does.
